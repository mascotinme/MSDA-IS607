> **ABSTRACT:**

* The project analysis is done on three (3) different datasets from different sources. The first dataset if from the University of California, Irvine website on **Air Quality**, the second dataset was extracted as an .xls file from World Bank website for the year **1961-1999**, while the third dataset was base on incident rate of leukemia in US States and was extracted from cancer.gov website.

* Analyses was done on all the three datasets to determine if the is linear relationship between them. I found out that the Air Quality has some of it variables that are way beyond the acceptable threnshold, I checked for interaction between those variables and benzene. I compared the result with the Leukemia incident rate in the 49 US States and the result is amazing. 

* We would **randomly** select observations to avoid bias.

* We would do some of the analysis on three(3) different programs; R, MySQL and MongoDB.


> **AIM AND OBJECTIVE:**

  * I am motivated by the serious impacts of the Air Quality throughout the whole world. Lots of adults, children are prone or exposed to the various categories of air throughout the globe. I thought it would be good to do an analysis to see the level of impact and to offer solutions.

> **What recommendations has the federal government made to protect human health?**


....EPA estimates that 10 ppb benzene in drinking water that is consumed regularly or exposure to 0.4 ppb in air over a lifetime could cause a risk of one additional cancer case for every 100,000 exposed persons......


+ The underlisted output displays the date, time of benzene with ppb greater than the safely regulated ppb for benzene.

* Alternative Hythesis: Not $H_o$
   
   $H_a:$  Not $H_o$  : $\mu_1$ $\neq$ $\mu_2$ $\neq$  $\mu_3$.....$\neq$ $\mu_n$


>  **Rejection**:

Reject $H_o$ (Null Hypothesis) if the calculated value (P-Value) is less that the tabulated value(Table value = *0.05* ), otherwise do not reject $H_o$



* Underlisted are the best variables for the model, and analysis would be made on them.


```{r}
modelselection <- lm(temp_ac ~ tin_oxide+hydrocarbon+benzene+titania+nitroge_oxide+tungsten.oxide+no2+tungsten_oxide_o2+indium_oxide+co+rh+ah, data=airqual)

stepwise <- step(modelselection, direction = "both") # Model Selection using both FORWARD AND BACKWARD selection.

summary(stepwise)

```


* We will like to further test by using another statistical tool called Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

> **ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA)**

```{r}
anova(stepwise, test= "F")
confint(stepwise)

```


> The Error Term or Residual

* We are going to check the distribution of the residuals with normal dataset distribution to determine the stochastics difference between the expected value and the observed value.

```{R}

residual_temp = data.frame(Fitted = fitted(stepwise),
Residuals = resid(stepwise), Treatment = airqual$temp_ac)

residual_benzene = data.frame(Fitted = fitted(stepwise),
Residuals = resid(stepwise), Treatment = airqual$benzene)



ggplot(residual_temp, aes(Fitted, Residuals, colour = Treatment)) + geom_point()
ggplot(residual_benzene, aes(Fitted, Residuals, colour = Treatment)) + geom_point()


```


**Decision & Conclusion:**

From the above multiple regression analysis and ANOVA, we found that the P-value is actually low compare to the Table value (0.05), we therefor reject $H_o$ (Null hypothesis) and conclude that there is/are difference(s) between the variables.




> **SECOND DATASET WAS EXTRACTED FROM THE WORLD BANK WEBSITE AS A .XLS FILE**

```


**Decision:**

We therefore Reject $H_o$, since calculated calculated value (P-Value) is greater than the tabulated value(Table value = *0.05* )



> **GENERAL CONCLUSION:**


Based on the above analyzes done on the three datasets, we therefore conclude that there are strong relationships between the carbon-monoxide (co), Temperature (temp_ac) and Benzene. Though, the datasets might not be enough to be able to determine the actual causes,  and links between the variables, we are strongly confident that a reduction in the exposure to their atmospheric condition (particularly Benzene) may aid in reducing leukemia in the United States and the World at large.

Note: The analysis is not exclusive as some other contributing factor(s) may also needs to be accessed.
