This is the solution to IS607 (Week 3) assignment. Thanks for your time. 

```{R, eval=TRUE}
#Before we proceed, lets install and load the packages below for easy accesibility to SQL.

#install.packages("RMySQL");
#install.packages("DBI");

library(DBI);
library("RMySQL");

# NOTE: my username = "root", password = "oracle", database_name = "diseases", and host = "localhost". You may be required to change these to your local or server access details.

disease = dbConnect(MySQL(), user='root', password='oracle', dbname='DISEASES', host='localhost');

# viewing the table lists in the database.

dbListTables(disease);

# Query from MySQL through R.

disease2 = dbSendQuery(disease, "SELECT T.SEX, T.CASE1, T.CASE2
FROM TB T
LEFT JOIN TB_POPULATION TP ON TP.COUNTRY = T.COUNTRY
LEFT JOIN POPULATION P ON TP.YEARS = P.YEARS
ORDER BY T.SEX, T.CASE1;");

# Viewing the sql query
disease3 = fetch(disease2, n=-1);
View(disease3);



# Now on R and Loading our databases (tb & population) from my local directory.

library(plyr);

tb1 = read.csv("C:/Data/tb.csv", head = TRUE, sep = ",");

population = read.csv("C:/Data/population.csv", head = TRUE, sep = ",");

# Renaming the tb column names

tb=rename(tb1, c("Afghanistan"="country", "X1995"="year", "female"="sex", "X.1"="case1", "X.1.1"="case2", "X.1.2"="case3"));

# A glance at the output after renaming.

head(tb);
head(population);

# Merging the databases together

diseases5 <- merge(tb, population, by =c("country", "year"));


# obtaining the column summation.

sum_all <- cbind(diseases5$case1+diseases5$case2+diseases5$case3);

# cases/population as asked in the assignment!

rate1 <- cbind(sum_all/diseases5$population);

# Combing resulting data with the both tb and population

diseases5["rate"] <- rate1;
head(diseases5);

# some statistics, Hooray! Here is the results...


display <- diseases5[, c("country","year","rate")];

summary(display$rate);
boxplot(display$rate);
head(display);

```
